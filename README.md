I have my three favorite lab projects that we have done during our time in the CPSC 120L class.

For our first lab, we started with the classic "Hello World" project. I really enjoyed this project,
as it was an amazing intro to the bare foundation for the entirety of the class. Despite me having
done this project prior to this class, it had enough of a difference and was in C++ rather than python
that it was still challenging as a bare beginner.

For the second lab that we have here lab 4, it is our unit conversion project, along with a high low game 
that we created. I found this project thoroughly enjoyable and also challenging! The units conversion 
was really our first big application of operators, and I found it simple enough yet just enough of a 
challenge programming it that it made it one of my favorites to work on! After that, we created the 
high low game, which me and my partner worked on, but in the end we found a flaw that gave us a fun
little laugh at the end. Noticing that the initial input of what the user has to guess is displayed
beyond the initial input was quite funny, as it defeated the purpose of the game. That last bit was 
a major contribution as to why I found enjoyment out of this project.

Our third and last, lab 9, is quite a similar case to the last project that was mentinoed. The work
me and my partner had to do for the spelling.cc was honestly very insightful, as it really put into
perspective how things like google docs works, along with other word processors. The second part to
this project was another number guessing game, but again this one I found funny as it had the same
flaw as our last game. This one also displayed the secret number after the user input it, thus
defeating the purpose of the game. Again this gave me a nice laugh after a long day, which is always
appreciated.
